== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPressÂ® installation, and then activate the plugin from the plugins page.

== Screenshots ==

1. The settings panel.
2. The player closed with a black skin.
3. The player opened with a green skin.
4. The edit properties button available in the post editor toolbar.
5. The properties window in the post editor.

== How it works: ==

1. Activate the mb.miniAudioPlayer plugin via the WP plugin panel;
2. Edit a post or a page, click on the Upload/Insert media link and choose an mp3 file;
3. place it into the post wherever you want to show the player.
4. save the post and browse it; the player will show instead of the link at the file.

to change the player default settings go to the mb.miniAudioPlayer settings panel (you can find it under the "settings" section of the WP backend).

**Options:**

* @ width = (int) the width in pixel of the player once opened.
* @ skin = the color of the player interface (black, blue, orange, red, gray and green).
* @ volume = (int) the initial volume of the player.
* @ showVolumeLevel = a boolean to show or hide the volume control.
* @ showTime = a boolean to show or hide the time counter.
* @ showRew = a boolean to show or hide the rewind control.
* @ autoPlay = (available only for the TinyMCE editor plugin) a boolean to set in play the player once the page is loaded.
* @ downloadable = a boolean to show the download button next to the player.
* @ excluded = a string containing the CSS class for audio links that should not be converted into player.

**Ubuntu Chromium issue**

Due to some codecs missing in the default Ubuntu Chromium install the player will not work. This problem can be resolved by simply installing that codecs via console:
sudo apt-get-install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra

After that your player should work fine.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin and the players are correctly displayed but the customization button doesn't show in the post editor =

 You have to check the "Activate the player customizer in the post editor" to make it available in the post editor.

= I inserted my mp3 file using the add media button but even when I select or click on the inserted link the customization button is disabled =

Be sure that once you inserted the file you set the "Attachment Display Settings -> Link" to "media file" in the media file window.

= I installed the plugin and now I can't display the post editor in "visual" mode anymore =

This is probably due to insufficient user permissions on your server that cause an error loading the TinyMCE mb.miniAudioPlayer component. You should try download the component locally on your computer, unzip it and upload the folder via FTP in the remote plugins folder.

= I installed the plugin but on the page there's only the link to the mp3 file and not the player =

Probably there's a conflict with some other installed plugin or even with the theme you are using.
Try first deactivating all the other plugins; if it works then reactivate them one by one to find out which is getting in conflict; if it doesn't work then there's a conflict with your theme.

= The player is working fine but it display differently from the examples you gave =

The appearance of the player is all defined in the "miniplayer.css" file located in the "css" folder of the plugin root. You maybe have some CSS classes that are overwriting the plugin ones.
You can inspect the player using the developer tools within the browser to find out which class is overwritten and fix the problem changing the theme css.

= It doesn't work on Firefox and neither on IE, what is the problem? =

On both those browsers the player falls back to the FlashÂ® solution instead of the standard HTML5; That because FF doesn't accept mp3 files natively and IE is a mess :-).
So if the player doesn't work on them probably is your Flash plugin that is not update or is not working correctly.

= It doesn't work on Ubuntu Chromium =

Due to some codecs missing in the default Ubuntu Chromium install the player will not work. This problem can be resolved by simply by installing that codecs via console:
sudo apt-get-install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra.
After that your player should work fine.

= I can't display the download button on touch devices =

The download button is intentionally removed on touch devices as it is impossible to download the file on that devices.
